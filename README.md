Hi there everyone,

My name is Paul, 

Welcome to my personal portfolio!

Welcome to my personal repository on GitHub, where I place all my university and self-iniated projects. 

On the screen, you can see various folders, each representing different aspects of Data Analytics. If you're interested in my projects implemeting Python to conduct data analysis, there's a dedicated folder for that. 
When I click on it, many sub-folders (different projects) appear.

Let's click on the a folder (or project) about car sales prediction. Each project typically contains several files: the dataset, the working file,  a Readme file that describes the project's purpose, and a video 
link from Google Drive attached at the end of the Readme file. The video, linked in the Readme file, provides a clear explanation of what I have done in each project.

If you have any queries, please email me to havinhnguyen24@gmail.com
